ICSOutlier : Invariant Coordinate Selection for Outlier Detection 

Invariante Coordinate Selection for outlier detection is a method proposed in the these of Aurore ARCHIBAUD "Methodes statistiques de détection d'observations atypiques pour des données en grande dimension" present in the folder. 

It is a methode of outlier detection based on Invariante Coordinate Selection proposed by Tyler in this [paper](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00706.x).

You will find also an implementation of this methode in a R [packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ICSOutlier/index.html) with its contain is discribed inside this [pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ICSOutlier/ICSOutlier.pdf).

### Prerequisites

Ananconda3 2020.02 (64-bit) avec Python version 3.7 : https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

### Installing

The ICSOutlier package is only implemenented in a R package. 
In order to use R on Jupyter Notebook you have to follow the first three steps in this tuto : 

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/ 

You have to notice that everytime you want to use R on Jupiter Notebook you have to repeat step 3.
